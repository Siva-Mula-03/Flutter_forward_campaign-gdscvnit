Introduction
Flutter is a powerful and intuitive framework for building beautiful, cross-platform mobile applications that uses the Dart programming language.

This essentially means that Flutter can be used to write one codebase for an app that runs natively on both iOS and Android.

With all the hype around Flutter and mobile app development, learning Flutter is both a valuable skill and a gratifying endeavor in its own right. However, the path to learning Flutter is a little unclear due to how new the language is.

the language is constantly being updated (to the point where tutorials from just a few months ago are out of date)
there are a lack of freely available, well thought out and comprehensive courses or books compared to some other more established frameworks and languages like python
This guide compiles tutorials, tips, examples (with screenshots), resources, and even an example project to help make the learning process for Flutter much easier. You can be a complete beginner, an intermediate or even advanced programmer to use this guide. I hope you find it helpful!

Note: See the 'code' folder in this repository for all of the code within this guide.

Getting Started
Before we get started with dart and flutter, we first need to set up our programming environment, which is what we will be using to code flutter apps.

The two main IDEs that provide the most features for Dart and Flutter are Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Android Studio. Choosing either one is up to you, but I do have a slight preference to VS Code because it looks sick...

Vim can also be used if you have coc or native lsp and install the dart and flutter extensions.

Choosing the right IDE is essential to getting all the features that the Dart programming language provides us with. Once you have your IDE / Text Editor, make sure you install the Dart extension and the Flutter extension. With these extensions, our IDE / Text Editor will perform extremely detailed error checking, type checking, null safety checks, and formatting to make our lives as developers a lot easier.

Once you have your environment set up, let's move on!
