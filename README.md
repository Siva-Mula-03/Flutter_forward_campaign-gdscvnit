Installation

The installation process can be a bit tricky for some users depending on the OS, but it
isn't too bad. Follow these resources to install Flutter and the necessary tools for your
OS (in addition to Flutter, you will also need an emulator / virtual phone in order to test
your apps).

Windows
● Flutter Docs - Windows Install
MacOS
● Flutter Docs - MacOS Install
Linux
● Flutter Docs - Linux Install

Once finished, run this command in the terminal to make sure your environment is all
ready to go.
$ flutter doctor
Create a flutter project with the following command.
$ flutter create <project_name>

The folder structure will look something like this. We will be putting all of our code in the
'lib' folder, and I'll explain the other folders later in the guide. For now, just follow along
with the code in the guide and don't worry about project setup just yet
